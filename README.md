# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# Styling Libraries:

@emotion/react and @emotion/styled: These are part of the Emotion library, a popular solution for styling React components. They provide a powerful and flexible way to manage CSS within your React application. You can use them to create styled components directly in your JavaScript code, keeping styles tightly coupled with the components they apply to.
# Material-UI Components:

@mui/material: This package offers a comprehensive set of pre-built React components that adhere to Google's Material Design guidelines. These components provide a consistent and visually appealing user interface for your web application. It includes elements like buttons, text fields, cards, menus, and more.
@mui/icons-material: This package provides a collection of Material Design icons that you can integrate seamlessly with your Material-UI components, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.
Date Handling:

@mui/x-date-pickers: This package, part of Material-UI, extends the functionality of Material-UI by offering date picker components. These components allow users to select dates from a calendar interface, providing a user-friendly way to interact with date data in your application.
date-fns@3.2: This is a popular JavaScript library for manipulating date and time objects. It provides a rich set of utilities for tasks like formatting dates, performing calculations, parsing dates from strings, and more. Specifying @3.2 ensures you're installing a specific version known to work well with @mui/x-date-pickers.
Form Management:

# react-hook-form: 
This library provides a declarative and performant way to handle forms in React applications. It simplifies form validation, error handling, and state management, making building complex forms easier and more efficient.
Data Validation:

# zod: 
Zod is a powerful type-safe data validation library for JavaScript. It allows you to define the expected structure and types of data your application receives, ensuring data integrity and preventing errors. This helps catch validation issues early in the development process.
Form Resolvers:

# @hookform/resolvers: 
This is an add-on library for react-hook-form that provides pre-built resolvers for popular validation libraries like zod. Resolvers streamline the integration of validation logic into your forms, reducing boilerplate code and simplifying the validation process.
Data Fetching:

# @tanstack/react-query:
This library provides a powerful abstraction layer for managing asynchronous data fetching in React applications. It simplifies data fetching logic, state management, caching, and error handling, making it easier to build complex data-driven UIs.
# HTTP Client:

axios: This is a popular promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript. It allows you to make HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to backend APIs or other web services, fetching data and communicating with your server.
# Utility Library:

lodash: Lodash is a utility library that provides a wide range of functions for common JavaScript tasks like array manipulation, object manipulation, string manipulation, and more. It can help you write more concise, readable, and maintainable code by reducing the need to write repetitive utility functions yourself.

# In summary:
Styling with Emotion
User interface components with Material-UI
Date pickers and date handling
Form management with React Hook Form
Data validation with Zod
Easy form validation integration with @hookform/resolvers
Asynchronous data fetching with React Query
Making HTTP requests with Axios
Code utility functions with Lodash
By combining these libraries, you can create a feature-rich, visually appealing, and well-structured React application that offers a great user experience.
